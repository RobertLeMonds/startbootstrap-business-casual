                                <p>I believe each student is unique, therefore that requires a unique approach to teaching and customizing a lesson plan catered to that student is what I feel is the best approach. Some of the material I use is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Elements-Strings-Book-Violin/dp/0634038176/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=essential+elements+violin&qid=1627256515&sr=8-1"> Essential Elements </a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Suzuki-Violin-School-Part-Vol/dp/0757900615/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1CX0955DY1X8P&dchild=1&keywords=suzuki+book+1+violin&qid=1627256546&sprefix=suzuki+book%2Caps%2C262&sr=8-1">Suzuki </a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/78VN-All-Strings-Book-Violin/dp/0849732220/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=all+for+strings&qid=1627256576&sr=8-1">All for Strings</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ABCs-Violin-Absolute-Beginner-Book/dp/0966373103/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=abcs+for+violin&qid=1627256453&sr=8-1">ABC’s of Violin </a>. The Suzuki method will always have a special place in my heart because I learned so much about the Violin through the repertoire provided. However, it’s not for everyone and I believe we should always have several “tools” in our belt to adjust to every type of student.

                                <p>That being said, Scales and Etudes are an <em>essential</em> component of any developing musician and necessary for a great foundation. As learning progresses I believe using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Franz-Wohlfahrt-Complete-Schirmer-Schirmers/dp/0634074032/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1NPDMEPAGB3CW&dchild=1&keywords=wolfhart+violin+studies+book+1&qid=1627257620&sprefix=wohlfhart%2Caps%2C236&sr=8-1">Wohlfahrt Sixty Studies for Violin </a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Contemporary-Violin-Technique-Exercises-Frederick/dp/B000VWYQ0C/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=galamian+scales&qid=1627257678&sr=8-2">Galamian Scales</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Basics-exercises-practice-routines-violin/dp/1901507009/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=simon+fischer+300&qid=1627257711&sr=8-1">Simon Fischers Basics</a> will reinforce those foundational learning elements.

                                <p><strong>30 Minutes: $30</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>45 Minutes: $45</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>60 Minutes: $60</strong></p>

                                <h3>PAYMENT</h3>
                                <p>All lesson payments are due upfront at the beginning of the month. I accept Venmo or Zelle, but prefer Cash or Check. If you are unable to pay for the full month I will work with you taking payment at the beginning of each lesson.</p>
                                <p>The Violin is one of the most challenging instruments anyone can play so it takes dedication, hard work, and patience. If for some reason after a few lessons you determine it's not right for you that's okay, but I do expect students to commit to at <strong><em>least</em></strong> three months to a year.</p>

                                <p><strong>Note: I do not offer Bi-weekly lessons as it's not conducive to the student or the teacher.</strong></p>

                                <br>
                                <p>I am military, so I am located in a military community which is off-base in the Tierrasanta Area. We have dogs and will make sure they are secured before arrival. For maximum productivity I <strong><em>do not</em></strong> travel to the student's home this allows for the student to be fully present and comfortable learning. This also keeps the environment more formal and professional.</p>
                                <p><strong>Parents:</strong> Please be on board in supporting the child in their progress, making sure they are practicing daily and weekly even if it's 15 minutes daily. Don't expect the child to want to practice daily, this is a committment and is challenging but rewarding.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h3>CANCELLATION POLICY</h3>
                                <p>Any lessons cancelled less than <em>24 hours </em>in advance will be charged <strong>IN FULL</strong>. I am flexible, so if someone is sick or there's an emergency we can reschedule. If you let me know more than 24 hours in advance I will be happy to accomodate. Please do <a href="tel:210-504-9610">TEXT or CALL</a> if something comes up.</p>
                                <p></p>

                                <p><strong>Note: I do not offer make-up lessons if there is zero communication or if someone forgets. If, for some reason you are more than 15 minutes late the lesson will either be cancelled or will be considered towards the allotted time.</strong></p> <p><strong>Once again, I am in the military and if for some reason I have a duty day or emergency that interferes with the student's lesson I will do my best to let you know ASAP, and will accommodate you. </strong></p>
